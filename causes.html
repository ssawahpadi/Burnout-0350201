			<h1>What causes Burnout?</h1>
		
			<p1>The causes of burnout can vary significantly depending on the setting in which it occurs. Whether in the workplace, caregiving, or personal life, burnout is often triggered by specific factors that lead to chronic stress and emotional exhaustion. Understanding these unique settings and their contributing factors is essential to recognizing and addressing burnout effectively.</p1>
